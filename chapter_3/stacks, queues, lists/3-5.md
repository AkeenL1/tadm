### Question:
```
We have seen how dynamic arrays enable arrays to grow while still achieving constant-time amortized performance. 
This problem concerns extending dynamic arrays to let them both grow and shrink on demand.

a.) Consider an underflow strategy that cuts the array size in half whenever
the array falls below half full. Give an example sequence of insertions and
deletions where this strategy gives a bad amortized cost.

b.) Then, give a better underflow strategy than that suggested above, one that
achieves constant amortized cost per deletion.
```

### Answer:
1. If we delete until the array is half full then add an element, then delete an element etc. This gives a bad amortized cost because on every insertion we are performing the O(n) cost of expansion
2. Only resize if the array drops to 1/4 full. This means after deletion we'll have a buffer and only resize every n/4 operations.
