### Question
```
Suppose you seek to maintain the contents of a refrigerator so as to minimize food spoilage. What data structure should you use, and how should you use it?
```

### Answer
If every element has the same "spoilage rate" I would use a queue, this way we know that we're always pulling out the food closest to spoiling

If the spoilage rate differs, I would use a sorted array based on the spoilage rate to make sure we pull out the food closest to spoiling.
